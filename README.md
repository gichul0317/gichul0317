<h1>Hello, I am Gichul Jaun. A Software Engineering student at Centennial College.</h1>

<p>
   I began my career as an IT Support and Security Specialist, assisting businesses in troubleshooting technical issues and optimizing their systems. Through hands-on experience with technology, I discovered my passion for software development and started learning independently through online resources. I later worked as a Web Developer, but to further enhance my skills, I am currently pursuing an Advanced Diploma in Software Engineering (AI) at Centennial College.
</p>
<p>
As a goal-driven team player, I thrive on making a positive impact in every collaboration. I actively support team efforts, tackle challenges head-on, and contribute to innovative problem-solving, all while continuously learning and improving. With a strong passion for exploring new programming libraries, tools, and concepts, I am eager to apply my skills and grow in a professional environment with exciting opportunities ahead.
